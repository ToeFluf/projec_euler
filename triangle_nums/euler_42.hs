The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1);

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

how many are triangle words are in p042_words.txt?
